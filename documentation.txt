Adding new HTML control:

1. add that item to the nhdfbtoolbox div in NHDformBuilder.html
    Example: <li>
                <div id="label" class="fieldTypeBtn" >Text Label</div>
            </li>
better set the id as actual the html control name.

2. Modify function appendInitialHtml(ui,placeholder) in file:nhdformbuilder.js (near line: 57 )

Example: if(item_id == "label"){
       jQuery( '<li class="'+new_item_class+'"><label id="'+new_element_id+'">'+ui.draggable.text()+'</label></li>' ).appendTo( placeholder );       
    }

add another if segment matching with the name you provided in 1st step.
here you'll setup the initial html code of the control.

3. Modify jQuery( "#placeholder li" ).live('click',function(){})
add another if segment like:
        if(item_class == "label_element"){         
           showLabelOptions(this); //label.js
       }
This calls the function of Options panel for this html control, happens when you click on a html control in the canvas.


4. create and include a new js file as label.js, include this toNHDformBuilder.html name it with the html control id (is a convention)
There you'll write the option bar's code, and the interaction between options and the canvas....


TO DO: 
Once enough html controls added successfully, entire form from the canvas , will converted to actual form html code.
Plan is, simply export the ul and li from #nhdfbcanvas div, so, while you create the form controls keep this in mind,
don't make these ul/li so much messy.....

Idea about Select option:
into the right side option panel, on the sortable,closeable li's, store the whole <option> tag as text in a div, 
to update canvas select options, read the options from li serially and then set those options to the dropdown...
